## Project Overview
This April 2025 Code Jam project uses a synthetic “Human Age Prediction” dataset (3,000 rows, 24 health & lifestyle features) to investigate how key physical metrics vary by age, gender, and chronic‐disease status.

---

## Dashboards & Story Points
1. **Physical Activity by Age & Gender**  
   – 100% stacked bars showing High, Moderate, Low activity split by three age groups and by gender (bar thickness).

2. **Chronic Disease Distribution by Age**  
   – Heat‐map of Diabetes, Heart Disease, Hypertension, and Healthy (“None”) rates in Young (1–30), Middle (31–60), Older (61+) cohorts.

3. **Heart Disease Risk: BMI vs. Cholesterol**  
   – Scatter of BMI (x) vs. Cholesterol (y) colored by Heart Disease vs. Healthy, sized by Blood Pressure, with obesity cutoff line.

4. **Diabetes Risk: Weight vs. Blood Glucose**  
   – Scatter of Weight (kg) vs. Blood Glucose (mg/dL) colored by Diabetes vs. Healthy, sized by Vision Sharpness, with 126 mg/dL cutoff.

5. **Hypertension Risk: Age vs. Systolic BP**  
   – Scatter of Age (years) vs. Systolic BP (mm Hg) colored by Hypertension vs. Healthy, sized by Diastolic BP, with 130 mm Hg cutoff line.

## Key Insights
- **Middle‑aged men** lead in Moderate activity (9.1% of participants).  
- **Chronic diseases** steadily rise with age, with hypertension most prevalent in the Older cohort.  
- **Physical markers** (cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure) effectively separate diseased vs. healthy groups, even when other metrics overlap.
